# timer
Created by: Shirley Ruan + Julia Liu
This is a timer to be used for karate tournaments
Since most timers are run through an application, this timer was created to be more accessible and user-friendly
It follows the latest USANKF rules
<br><br>
TOURNAMENT SET UP
Two competitors will compete at a time, one as red (aka) and one as blue (ao).
The timer is to run for 2 minutes, unless the competitors are 11 years of age or under
The timer will buzz when there is 15 seconds left
<br><br>
SCORING SYSTEM
Punches (to the head or to the body) are worth 1 point--"yuko"
Kicks to the body are worth 2 points--"wazari"
Kicks to the head and takedowns are worth 3 points--"ippon"
Whoever scores the first point is marked with "seishun" and will win in the case of a tie
In the case of a 0-0 tie, the judges will decide the winner (hantei)
Whoever earns the most points at the end of the timer is the winner
If a competitor earns 8 points before the end of the match, they will be declared the winner
Must have at least two judges in agreement about a point before it can be awarded

PENALTIES
There are two categories of penalties
Category 1 pertains to aggression/injuring an opponent
Category 2 pertains to sportsmanship
