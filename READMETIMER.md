# timer
Created by: Shirley Ruan + Julia Liu, 2017<br>
This is a timer to be used for karate tournaments<br>
Since most timers are run through an application, this timer was created to be more accessible and user-friendly<br>
It follows the latest USANKF rules
<br><br>
<strong>TOURNAMENT SET UP</strong><br>
Two competitors will compete at a time, one as red (aka) and one as blue (ao).<br>
The timer is to run for 2 minutes, unless the competitors are 11 years of age or under (in which case it will run for 1:30)<br>
The timer will buzz when there is 15 seconds left
<br><br>
<strong>SCORING SYSTEM</strong><br>
Punches (to the head or to the body) are worth 1 point--"yuko"<br>
Kicks to the body are worth 2 points--"wazari"<br>
Kicks to the head and takedowns are worth 3 points--"ippon"<br>
Whoever scores the first point is marked with "seishun" and will win in the case of a tie<br>
In the case of a 0-0 tie, the judges will decide the winner (hantei)<br>
Whoever earns the most points at the end of the timer is the winner<br>
If a competitor earns 8 points before the end of the match, they will be declared the winner<br>
Must have at least two judges in agreement about a point before it can be awarded
<br><br>
<strong>PENALTIES</strong><br>
There are two categories of penalties<br>
Category 1 pertains to aggression/injuring an opponent<br>
Category 2 pertains to sportsmanship<br>
Competitors are allowed 3 penalties (chukoku, keikoku, hansoku chui, respectively) under each category<br>
The 4th offense (hansoku) will result in disqualification<br>
Penalties can be elevated if the judges find fit <br>
Penalties will automatically be elevated to the third offense (hansoku chui) within the last 15 seconds of the match <br>
